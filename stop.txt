12 Commandments to Quit Being a Little B!%ch

1. Read: millionaire Fast Lane for minimum 2 hours per day & take notes. Share notes and thoughts in this group.

2. Consumption detox: Zero garbage or show consumption. You're going to suffer from withdrawal. That's okay.

3. Track time: set alarm every 30 min & track.

4. Daily Outreach: 30 prospects per day.

5. Zero Ego: Extreme learner attitude. Leave your defense mechanism at the door. Either have zero ego or zero profit. Your choice. Put it another way... If you want to keep your ego, you get to keep your debt. Simple.

6. Don't hurt your little brain: If someone is 10x ahead of you, BLINDLY follow. Take their word as word of God. Being a smart ass will keep you broke. If you spend 50% of your time questioning & challenging instead of executing... You'll retard your growth by 50%.

7. Be religious to profit: If you can 2x your income but it requires you to do a complete 180 from your current plan... Be open to it. Nothing else matters... Hours worked, logo design, website, funnel, ads, or that book you wanna release telling your life story. If you're broke you can't impact millions of people or have freedom.

8. Attitude: No bitching, drama, complaining, negativity, or whining. Strictly positive attitude.

9. 1,000 Commitment Club: you need to be 1,000% committed. 100% is weak. Flaky half ass bullshit will give you just that, a wallet with money that seems to keep flaking on you.

10. Producer Re-orientation: Produce 1 valuable thing every day. Consumers are majority. Majority are broke. Producers are minority. Minority is rich. Be the minority. Become a producer.

11. Accountability & Tracking: Track everything daily that matters to you and get a trusted person to audit it... Every. Single. Day. (Income, net worth, sleep, calories, water, credit score, weight).

None of this is optional. If you want $20k/month results. This is the cost.

12. Final step: Read this every single day. Frame it on your wall. Screen cover on your phone.
